Hello there, Affiliate users!

I am happy to announce that Affiliate Magnet will now support Amazon links. It will work with
[all major domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)#Website) around the world.
Now, the bot supports a total of three websites.

You can configure your Amazon options in a similar way to how you do for Unity and Humble Bundle.
A new set of commands have been added under `/set amazon` to set your 
[affiliate_tag](/docs/options/amazon/affiliate_tag) and [replace_mode](/docs/options/amazon/replace_mode).

## How to set up affiliate replacing for Amazon

1. First, set your affiliate tag by running `/set amazon affiliate_tag <your affiliate tag>`
2. Set your bot to replace affiliate links by running `/set amazon replace_mode Replace`


## What's next?

In the near future, I have planned to add the option to customise the text which is sent
before the message. Bored of the same old "From @member:" ? You'll be able to have more
variety soon :)

Also, which website should I add next? Let me know in the [support server](https://discord.gg/qJnrRvt7wW).
