# Getting Started

## Invite the bot

If you haven't already, [invite Affiliate Magnet](/docs/invite) to your server.

## Start the Setup

When the bot joins your server, it will send a message prompting you to set it up. The bot
will start replacing links only after it has been set up.

Click on the Setup button to start the setup.

:::info
Only a server admin can set up the bot.

Server admin is any member with the `Manage Server` permission

## Set up the websites you want

For each supported website, you can set your affiliate code/id, as well as the
[replace_mode](/docs/options/unity/replace_mode).

## Finish

Once you are done setting up the website(s) you want, click on the Finish
button. This actually enables the bot, to start replacing or clearing links.

If, by mistake, you dismissed the message before clicking Finish, you can
enable the bot yourself by running the slash command `/set enabled True`.



## Done!

Your bot has been set up and ready to rock! You can now delete the setup
messages.
