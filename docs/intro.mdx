# Getting Started

## Invite the bot

If you haven't already, **invite Affiliate Magnet** to your server. There are two ways to do this:

- Authorize the bot by going to [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=891700586288934952&permissions=277025401856&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

- Invite the bot from Discord

If the bot is already in a server you are in, you can easily invite it to your server 
by clicking on **Add to Server** on its profile.

<img alt="inviting the bot" src="/img/intro/invite-profile.png" />

Select the server you want to invite it to, and click on **Continue**

<img alt="selecting server to invite" style={{ height: "500px" }} src="/img/intro/select-server.png" />

Make sure it has all these permissions, and click on **Authorize**

<img alt="granting permissions" style={{ height: "600px" }} src="/img/intro/grant-perms.png" />

## Set your affiliate code

If you want the bot to replace links with your affiliate code, you first need to set your affiliate code.

:::info

You don't need to set the affiliate code if you just want to use the `Clear` mode

:::

This can be done using the `/set` slash command, which is used to change various server settings
(know more here)

To set your affiliate code, type out `/set unity code` and make sure the slash command menu opens up.
Then, enter your affiliate code in the `value` field and press enter. If there is no problem, your code
will be saved and you will see a confirmation.

<img style={{ height: "150px" }} src="/img/intro/conf-aff.png" />

## Set the Replace Mode

Replace mode specifies how links are to be handled. `Clear` will clear any affiliate link posted on your server,
and `Replace` will replace it with your own

:::info

If you wish to use the `Replace` mode, your affiliate code should be set beforehand

:::

You can set the replace mode using `/set unity replace_mode`, similar to how you set the affiliate code.

<img style={{ height: "200px" }} src="/img/intro/set-mode.png" />
<img style={{ height: "150px" }} src="/img/intro/conf-mode.png" />

## Enable the bot

The bot is disabled by default when it joins a server. To start it up, use the command `/set enabled`
and set enabled to True.

<img style={{ height: "120px" }} src="/img/intro/set-enabled.png" />
<img style={{ height: "150px" }} src="/img/intro/conf-enabled.png" />

## You're ready to go!

The bot is now set up and ready to replace links! Here is an example:
