The [slash command](/docs/commands) `/set` can be used to change various server options.

## Usage

`/set <option name> [value: <option value>]`

Here, `option name` is the name of the option you want to set.
In case of nested options, put a space between the parent and child
options.

`value` is a required argument, which is the value you want to set
the option to.

## Examples

To enable the bot: `/set enabled [value: True]`
