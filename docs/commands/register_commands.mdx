This command register all server commands, in case they have not been registered already in a server.

If you invite the bot to your server while it is online, server-only commands like `affiliate`, `config`
and `set` will not be available in your server. You can then run this command to register the commands
in your server once the bot is back online.

## Usage

`/register_commands [server_id: <your server id>]`
