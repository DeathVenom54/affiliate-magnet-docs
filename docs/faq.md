# Frequently Asked Questions

### Will the bot support any other websites?

Affiliate Magnet is an evolving bot. I will keep adding support for more and more websites.
If you have an idea for a site that can be added, let me know in the [support server](https://discord.gg/qJnrRvt7wW).

### Why are some commands greyed out?

Some commands like [/set](/docs/commands/set) and [/config](/docs/commands/config) are only available to 
admins. It is greyed out for members who do not have the `Manage Guild` permission.

### If I disable the bot, can I still use the /affiliate command?

Yes, you definitely can.
